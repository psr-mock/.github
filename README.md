This is a collection of lightweight PHP libraries tailored for writing mocked tests.

Each of these libraries fulfils the requirements of a particular PHP-FIG PSR implementation, indicated by the library's name. These enable developers to write robust test suites targeting support for these standards without requiring a full production implementation as a development dependency.

In some cases, these libraries can also provide extra tooling that helps with diagnosing issues and finding performance bottlenecks.

These libraries are not produced, endorsed or otherwise affiliated with the PHP-FIG.
